# Giphy API

### Overview

Uses the GIPHY API to populate the web page with gifs. 

* The page loads with a default list of topics that display as buttons the user can click. 

	* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. 

		* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

		* Under every gif, its rating is displayed

* There is also a form that takes the value from a user input box and adds it as a button to display on the page.
